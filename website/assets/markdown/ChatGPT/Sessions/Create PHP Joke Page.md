# Create PHP Joke Page
## Mark Hazleton:
Create a PHP page that makes a call to the joke api https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any?safe-mode and then displays the results on the page. Add a button to refresh the joke
## chatgpt:
Creating a PHP page to fetch data from an API and display it involves a few steps. You would need to make an HTTP request to the specified API, parse the response, and then render it on the page. Below is a simple example of how you could accomplish this task:

1.  **Create a new PHP file (e.g., `index.php`):**

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Joke Display</title>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<div id="joke-container">
    <!-- Joke will be displayed here -->
</div>

<button onclick="fetchJoke()">Fetch a new Joke</button>

<script type="text/javascript">
    function fetchJoke() {
        $.ajax({
            url: 'fetch_joke.php',
            method: 'GET',
            success: function(response) {
                $('#joke-container').html(response);
            }
        });
    }

    // Fetch joke on page load
    $(document).ready(function() {
        fetchJoke();
    });
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

2.  **Create a new PHP file (e.g., `fetch_joke.php`):**

```php
<?php
// Function to make GET request using cURL
function curlGet($url) {
    $ch = curl_init(); // initialize curl handle

    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url); // set url to post to
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); // return into a variable
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 10); // times out after 10s

    $result = curl_exec($ch); // run the whole process
    curl_close($ch); 
    
    return $result;
}

$api_url = "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any?safe-mode";
$response = curlGet($api_url);
$joke_data = json_decode($response, true);

// Check if it's a single or two-part joke
if(isset($joke_data['joke'])) {
    echo $joke_data['joke'];
} else {
    echo $joke_data['setup'] . '<br>' . $joke_data['delivery'];
}
?>
```

In this setup:

-   In `index.php`, a button is created which, when clicked, triggers a JavaScript function `fetchJoke()`. This function makes an AJAX request to `fetch_joke.php`.
-   In `fetch_joke.php`, a function `curlGet` is defined to make a GET request to the specified API URL using cURL. The response is then parsed from JSON into a PHP associative array.
-   Depending on whether the joke is a single-part or two-part joke, it is then outputted appropriately.
-   On page load and every time the button is clicked, a new joke is fetched and displayed in the `joke-container` div.

## Mark Hazleton:
Use Bootstrap to add some style to the button and display of a joke
## chatgpt:
Bootstrap is a great framework to quickly style elements on a webpage. Hereâ€™s how you might modify the `index.php` and `fetch_joke.php` files from the previous example to incorporate Bootstrap styles:

1.  **Modify `index.php` to include Bootstrap and style the button and joke container:**

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Joke Display</title>
    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<div class="container mt-5">
    <div id="joke-container" class="mb-3 p-3 border rounded">
        <!-- Joke will be displayed here -->
    </div>

    <button onclick="fetchJoke()" class="btn btn-primary">Fetch a new Joke</button>
</div>

<script type="text/javascript">
    function fetchJoke() {
        $.ajax({
            url: 'fetch_joke.php',
            method: 'GET',
            success: function(response) {
                $('#joke-container').html(response);
            }
        });
    }

    // Fetch joke on page load
    $(document).ready(function() {
        fetchJoke();
    });
</script>

<!-- Bootstrap JS and Popper.js (included for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.9/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```

2.  **No modification is needed in `fetch_joke.php`**

In the `index.php` file:

-   Bootstrap CSS is included in the `<head>` section using a CDN link.
-   The Bootstrap class `container` is used to center and pad the content, and `mt-5` (margin-top 5 units) is used to add some space at the top of the page.
-   The joke container div is styled with `mb-3` (margin-bottom 3 units), `p-3` (padding 3 units), `border`, and `rounded` classes to give it a border, rounded corners, and some padding and margin.
-   The button is styled with the `btn` and `btn-primary` classes to give it a Bootstrap button style.

## Mark Hazleton:
add some style to the formatting of the joke as well, put labels for setup and punchline
## chatgpt:
To improve the formatting of the joke and add labels for the setup and punchline, you can make some changes to the `fetch_joke.php` file to include Bootstrap classes and HTML structure. Here's how you might modify `fetch_joke.php`:

```php
<?php
// Function to make GET request using cURL
function curlGet($url) {
    $ch = curl_init(); // initialize curl handle

    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url); // set url to post to
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); // return into a variable
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 10); // times out after 10s

    $result = curl_exec($ch); // run the whole process
    curl_close($ch); 
    
    return $result;
}

$api_url = "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any?safe-mode";
$response = curlGet($api_url);
$joke_data = json_decode($response, true);

// Check if it's a single or two-part joke
if(isset($joke_data['joke'])) {
    echo "<p><strong>Joke:</strong> {$joke_data['joke']}</p>";
} else {
    echo "<p><strong>Setup:</strong> {$joke_data['setup']}</p>";
    echo "<p><strong>Punchline:</strong> {$joke_data['delivery']}</p>";
}
?>
```

In the `fetch_joke.php` file:

-   HTML paragraph (`<p>`) elements are used to wrap the text content.
-   Bootstrap's `<strong>` element is used to bold the labels "Setup" and "Punchline" (or "Joke" for a single-part joke).
-   The actual text of the setup, punchline, or joke is inserted next to the respective labels.

Now, when you load `index.php` in your browser and click the button to fetch a joke, the setup and punchline (or the entire joke for single-part jokes) will be formatted with labels, making it clear which part of the text is the setup and which is the punchline.

## Mark Hazleton:
when I include the page in my PHP Web CMS, the load on button push works great, but the load on document ready does not Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
## chatgpt:
The error `Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined` is indicating that jQuery (which defines the `$` symbol) has not been loaded yet when your script is trying to run. This could happen if the script is being executed before the jQuery library has been fully loaded into the page.

In the provided code snippet from earlier, the jQuery library is included right at the top of the `head` section. However, if this script is being included within a larger system, there might be other factors at play such as the order in which scripts are being loaded, or potentially conflicting versions of jQuery.

A common approach to ensure your script runs after jQuery has loaded is to place your script right before the closing `</body>` tag or use the `window.onload` event. Here's an updated version of your `index.php` file with the latter approach applied:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Joke Display</title>
    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
</head>
<body>

<div class="container mt-5">
    <div id="joke-container" class="mb-3 p-3 border rounded">
        <!-- Joke will be displayed here -->
    </div>

    <button onclick="fetchJoke()" class="btn btn-primary">Fetch a new Joke</button>
</div>

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    function fetchJoke() {
        $.ajax({
            url: 'fetch_joke.php',
            method: 'GET',
            success: function(response) {
                $('#joke-container').html(response);
            }
        });
    }

    // Use window.onload to ensure jQuery is loaded
    window.onload = function() {
        fetchJoke();
    };
</script>

<!-- Bootstrap JS and Popper.js (included for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.9/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```

In this updated version:

-   The jQuery library is moved to just before your script.
-   Your `$(document).ready()` function is replaced with `window.onload = function() { ... };` to ensure `fetchJoke` is called once the entire page (including jQuery) is fully loaded.

This change should resolve the `Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined` error you were encountering.

Title: Implementation of Dynamic Joke Display Feature on Company Website

Summary: The project entailed the creation and integration of a dynamic feature on the company's website that fetches and displays jokes from an external API. This was achieved through a two-part PHP script system. The implementation promotes user engagement by offering fresh content on-demand with a "Fetch a new Joke" button, enhancing the interactive user experience.

Key Points:

1.  **Development and Integration**: A PHP page was developed to interact with an external joke API. This page was integrated into the existing Web CMS, ensuring seamless operation with the current website setup.
2.  **User Interaction**: A button was introduced on the webpage allowing users to fetch and view new jokes, thus promoting user engagement with the website.
3.  **Styling and Formatting**: Utilizing the Bootstrap framework, the button and joke display were styled for a visually appealing presentation. Labels were added for better clarity between the setup and punchline of the jokes.
4.  **Troubleshooting and Optimization**: An initial issue with the joke display on page load was resolved by adjusting the script loading sequence, ensuring the feature operates correctly on both manual button interaction and automatic page load.

This enhancement aligns with the company's initiative to foster a user-friendly and engaging digital environment. By continuously addressing user interaction and visual appeal, we are moving in the right direction towards a more engaging and user-friendly online platform.
