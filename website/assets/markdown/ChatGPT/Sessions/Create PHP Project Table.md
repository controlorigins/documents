# Create PHP Project Table
## Mark Hazleton:
I have a list of projects in a JSON file in the following format.  
 \[  
    {  
        "image": "assets/img/frogsfolly.png",  
        "p": "Frogsfolly",  
        "d": " My first website, setup to share photos with my family but is now a 'Kitchen Sink' of demos and test ideas. The site is built with Web Project Mechanics CMS.",  
        "h": "https://frogsfolly.com"  
    }  
\]  
 Create a project-table.php that takes the content of the projects.json file and puts them in an html table with one column for each field. For the "h" field, make it a anchor tag <a> with the href attribute eaqual to what is in the h field that opens a new brower window.

To create a `project-table.php` file that reads the content of the `projects.json` file and generates an HTML table with one column for each field, including a link for the "h" field, you can use PHP. Here's a sample `project-table.php` code:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Project Table</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Image</th>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Link</th>
        </tr>
        <?php
        $jsonFile = 'projects.json';
        $jsonData = file_get_contents($jsonFile);
        $projects = json_decode($jsonData, true);

        if ($projects !== null) {
            foreach ($projects as $project) {
                echo '<tr>';
                echo '<td><img src="' . $project['image'] . '" alt="' . $project['p'] . '"></td>';
                echo '<td>' . $project['p'] . '</td>';
                echo '<td>' . $project['d'] . '</td>';
                echo '<td><a href="' . $project['h'] . '" target="_blank">' . $project['h'] . '</a></td>';
                echo '</tr>';
            }
        }
        ?>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

In this code:

1. We read the content of the `projects.json` file using `file_get_contents` and decode it into an associative array using `json_decode`.
1. We then iterate through the array of projects and generate a table row (`<tr>`) for each project.
1. Inside each table row, we create table data (`<td>`) for the "Image," "Name," "Description," and "Link" fields. For the "Link" field, we create an anchor (`<a>`) tag with the `href` attribute set to the URL from the "h" field, and we use the `target="_blank"` attribute to open the link in a new browser window.
1. The table headers (`<th>`) are added for each column.
1. Finally, the HTML table is displayed on the page. When you access this `project-table.php` file in your web browser, it will generate the table with the project data from the JSON file.

Format the table for bootstrap and limit the images to thumbnail size (max 100 px wide)
## chatgpt:

To format the table using Bootstrap and limit the images to a thumbnail size (max 100px wide), you can modify the `project-table.php` code as follows:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Project Table</title>
    <!-- Add Bootstrap CSS link -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <style>
        /* CSS for limiting image width */
        .thumbnail-img {
            max-width: 100px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container mt-4">
        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Image</th>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                    <th>Link</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <?php
                $jsonFile = 'projects.json';
                $jsonData = file_get_contents($jsonFile);
                $projects = json_decode($jsonData, true);

                if ($projects !== null) {
                    foreach ($projects as $project) {
                        echo '<tr>';
                        echo '<td><img src="' . $project['image'] . '" alt="' . $project['p'] . '" class="thumbnail-img"></td>';
                        echo '<td>' . $project['p'] . '</td>';
                        echo '<td>' . $project['d'] . '</td>';
                        echo '<td><a href="' . $project['h'] . '" target="_blank">' . $project['h'] . '</a></td>';
                        echo '</tr>';
                    }
                }
                ?>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

In this updated code:

1. We added a link to the Bootstrap CSS in the `<head>` section to apply Bootstrap styling to the table.
1. We added a `<style>` block to limit the maximum width of images to 100px by applying the `thumbnail-img` class to the images.
1. We wrapped the entire table inside a Bootstrap container (`<div class="container">`) and added some margin to give it spacing.
1. We used Bootstrap classes for the table (`table table-bordered`) to style it nicely.

Now, when you open this `project-table.php` file in a web browser, it will display a Bootstrap-styled table with thumbnail-sized images and other project information.

Explain in non-technical terms for an audience of executives what we just did
## chatgpt:
Certainly! Here's an explanation in non-technical terms for executives:

We've just created a web page that presents your list of projects in a clean and organized way. This web page is designed to make it easy for anyone to see what projects you have, their names, descriptions, and links to their respective websites.

Here's a breakdown of what we did:

1. **Styling with Bootstrap:** We used a popular web design framework called Bootstrap to make the web page look professional and consistent. Bootstrap helps in creating a visually appealing table and ensures that it adapts well to different screen sizes, which is important for a modern web experience.
1. **Thumbnail Images:** We made sure that the images associated with your projects are displayed as small "thumbnail" images. These images won't be too large, ensuring that they fit neatly in the table and don't overwhelm the page. Each image is limited to a maximum width of 100 pixels.
1. **Table Structure:** The project information is organized in a table format. This means you have a clear column for each piece of information - the project image, the project name, a brief description, and a link to the project's website.
1. **Clickable Links:** We made the website links clickable. When you or anyone else clicks on one of these links, it opens a new browser window or tab so you can easily visit the project's website.
    

In summary, we've transformed your project list into an attractive and user-friendly web page that not only showcases your projects but also makes it convenient for you and your audience to access further details about each project by clicking on the provided links. This can be a valuable tool for sharing and discussing your projects with others.
