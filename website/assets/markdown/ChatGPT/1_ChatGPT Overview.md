# Chat GPT Overview

<a id="top"></a>
  
Chat GPT (short for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI . OpenAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory. It is designed to be able to generate human-like responses to text input and has been trained on a large dataset of text in order to learn the patterns and nuances of human language.  
  
The language model can answer questions, and assist you with tasks such as composing emails, essays, and code. Usage is currently open to the public free of charge because ChatGPT is in its research and feedback-collection phase.  
  
While some of the underlying technology behind Chat GPT is open source, the specific model and its trained parameters are likely proprietary to OpenAI. Currently, Chat GPT is only available as a cloud-based service and is not available for installation on an internal network.  
  
Chat GPT learns through a process called training, where it is fed a large dataset of text and uses this data to learn patterns and relationships in language. It then uses this knowledge to generate responses to new text input.
