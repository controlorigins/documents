## 🎯 **The Challenge: Complex Azure Routing Issues**

**Problem**: PHPDocSpark running on Azure App Service (Linux + Nginx) was experiencing 502 errors with custom PHP routing—a common but notoriously difficult issue involving the intersection of PHP, Nginx, and Azure's container architecture.

**Traditional Approach Would Have Required**:

- ✗ Manual Microsoft documentation research (30-60 minutes)
- ✗ Stack Overflow searching and trial-and-error
- ✗ Multiple Azure Portal sessions to inspect configuration
- ✗ Separate Azure CLI sessions for diagnostics
- ✗ Back-and-forth between documentation, terminal, and browser

**Copilot Agent Mode Delivered**:

- ✅ **Real-time Microsoft documentation retrieval** via MCP servers
- ✅ **Live Azure resource inspection** without leaving VS Code
- ✅ **Automated configuration generation** based on latest best practices
- ✅ **End-to-end solution in under 10 minutes**

## 🧠 **AI Agent Mode in Action: The Process**

---

## � **The AI Agent Workflow Revolution**

### **Step 1: Intelligent Problem Analysis** 🔍

**Mark's Prompt**: *"Our Azure App Service is showing 502 errors for PHP routing. Can you help diagnose and fix this?"*

**Copilot's AI Agent Response**: Instead of generic advice, the agent immediately:

1. **Analyzed the project context** from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. **Identified the tech stack**: PHP 8.2+, Azure App Service on Linux, custom routing
3. **Activated MCP servers** to gather real-time information

### **Step 2: Real-Time Microsoft Documentation Retrieval** 📚

**The Game Changer**: Using **MCP Microsoft Documentation Server**, Copilot instantly accessed:

- **Latest Azure App Service best practices** (not cached or outdated information)
- **PHP on Linux container specifications** directly from Microsoft Learn
- **Nginx configuration patterns** for Azure-specific environments
- **Official startup command examples** with version-specific guidance

**What This Means**: No more hunting through documentation, no more outdated Stack Overflow answers—direct access to Microsoft's authoritative, up-to-date guidance.

### **Step 3: Live Azure Resource Inspection** ☁️

**Revolutionary Capability**: Using **MCP Azure Servers**, the agent:

```bash
# Automatically executed via MCP Azure Extension:
# - Connected to Azure subscription
# - Inspected PHPDocSpark App Service configuration
# - Analyzed current startup commands and environment variables  
# - Reviewed deployment logs and error messages
# - Identified Nginx vs Apache configuration conflicts
```

**Without ever leaving VS Code**, the agent had complete visibility into:

- Current app service configuration
- Runtime environment details
- Error logs and diagnostic information
- Available configuration options

### **Step 4: Intelligent Solution Generation** ⚙️

Based on the **combination of**:

- ✅ Live Azure resource state
- ✅ Latest Microsoft best practices
- ✅ Project-specific context from copilot-instructions.md
- ✅ Current error patterns

**Copilot automatically generated**:

1. **Custom nginx.conf** with Azure App Service-optimized settings
2. **Proper startup command** using Microsoft's recommended pattern
3. **Azure CLI commands** for deployment and verification
4. **Troubleshooting steps** tailored to the specific environment

## 🎯 **The Technical Solution** (AI-Generated)

## The Problem

- **✗ `.htaccess` files are completely ignored by Nginx**
- **✗ Apache-style rewrites don't work**
- **✅ Need Nginx-specific configuration**

## Files Created/Updated

1. **`nginx.conf`** - Custom Nginx server configuration (based on Microsoft examples)
2. **Startup Command** - Set via Azure CLI to copy config and restart Nginx

## ✅ **Official Microsoft Pattern Applied**

### Step 1: Custom Nginx Configuration

Created `/home/site/wwwroot/nginx.conf` with the standard App Service pattern:

```nginx
server {
    listen 8080;
    listen [::]:8080;
    root /home/site/wwwroot;

    location / {            
        index  index.php index.html index.htm hostingstart.html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+?\.php)(|/.*)$;
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        # ... other FastCGI params
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Startup Command Configuration

Applied via Azure CLI (following official Microsoft documentation):

```bash
az webapp config set \
  --name PHPDocSpark \
  --resource-group rg-controlorigins-docs \
  --startup-file "cp /home/site/wwwroot/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/default && service nginx reload"
```

This is **exactly the pattern** shown in Microsoft's Laravel tutorials and PHP documentation.

## Testing the Fix

After deployment, the routing should work for URLs like:

- `https://phpdocspark.azurewebsites.net/doc/seo`
- `https://phpdocspark.azurewebsites.net/doc/chatgpt/sessions/create-php-joke-page`

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

1. Deploy your updated code with the new configuration files
2. Visit: `https://phpdocspark.azurewebsites.net/diagnostics.php`
3. Test the URL: `https://phpdocspark.azurewebsites.net/doc/seo`

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Azure Portal Configuration

If you prefer using the Azure Portal:

1. Go to App Service → Configuration → General Settings
2. Set Startup Command to: `startup.sh`
3. Save and restart the app

### Option 2: Check Deployment Logs

If the fix doesn't work immediately:

```bash
az webapp log tail --name PHPDocSpark --resource-group rg-controlorigins-docs
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **404 errors persist**: Check if startup.sh is executing by viewing logs
2. **Server errors**: Check Application Logs in Azure Portal
3. **Nginx config not applied**: Verify startup command is set to "startup.sh"
4. **Still not working**: Add debug logging to startup.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting custom startup script..." >> /home/site/startup.log
if [ -f /home/site/wwwroot/nginx.conf ]; then
    cp /home/site/wwwroot/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    echo "Custom nginx configuration applied" >> /home/site/startup.log
else
    echo "ERROR: nginx.conf not found" >> /home/site/startup.log
fi
service nginx restart >> /home/site/startup.log 2>&1
```

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the new `nginx.conf` and updated `startup.sh`
2. **Azure will automatically deploy** via GitHub Actions
3. **Test the URL**: <https://phpdocspark.azurewebsites.net/doc/seo>
4. **Check logs if needed**: `az webapp log tail --name PHPDocSpark --resource-group rg-controlorigins-docs`

The routing should now work correctly with the Nginx configuration!
