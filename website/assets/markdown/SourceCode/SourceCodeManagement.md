# Source Code Management

## Why Souce Code Management?

Source Code Management (SCM), also known as Version Control, offers several benefits to small companies with only a few developers. Even with a small team, implementing SCM can significantly improve the development process and code management. Here are the benefits:

1. **Version Control:**

   - Easily track changes: SCM systems like Git allow developers to track changes made to the codebase over time. This helps in understanding who made what changes and when.
   - Rollback to previous versions: SCM enables you to revert to previous versions of your code in case of bugs or issues, providing a safety net for your projects.

1. **Collaboration:**

   - Parallel Development: Multiple developers can work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. SCM helps merge these changes seamlessly.
   - Code Review: SCM tools often support code review processes, making it easier for small teams to collaborate on code improvements.

1. **Backup and Recovery:**

   - Data Protection: SCM systems serve as a backup for your codebase. In case of data loss or system failures, you can recover your code from the repository.
   - Disaster Recovery: SCM repositories can be hosted on remote servers, providing disaster recovery capabilities for your code.

1. **Code Quality:**

   - Code Consistency: SCM encourages best practices in code development. You can enforce coding standards, code reviews, and quality checks before code is merged into the main branch.
   - Continuous Integration: Integrating SCM with CI/CD pipelines can automate testing and deployment, ensuring code quality with each change.

1. **Traceability:**

   - Issue Tracking: Many SCM systems integrate with issue tracking tools, making it easier to link code changes to specific issues, enhancements, or bug reports.
   - Audit Trails: SCM systems maintain an audit trail of all changes, which can be valuable for compliance and debugging purposes.

1. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:**

   - Commit Messages: Developers can provide descriptive commit messages, making it easier for team members to understand the purpose of each change.
   - Documentation: SCM can host documentation files alongside the code, ensuring that project-related information is readily available to all team members.

1. **Branching and Experimentation:**

   - Feature Branches: SCM allows you to create feature branches, where developers can work on new features or experimental changes independently, reducing the risk of destabilizing the main codebase.
   - Code Experimentation: Developers can experiment with new ideas without affecting the stable version, fostering innovation.

1. **Future Scalability:**

   - As your small company grows, SCM provides a solid foundation for scaling your development efforts, accommodating more developers and complex projects.

1. **Code Reusability:**

   - SCM enables you to create libraries or components that can be reused across projects, saving time and maintaining consistency.

1. **Security:**

   - Access Control: You can define who has access to the codebase and what level of access they have, ensuring data security and code integrity.

In summary, even for small companies with a limited number of developers, SCM offers numerous advantages, including improved collaboration, code quality, and disaster recovery. It also fosters a more organized and efficient development process, setting the stage for future growth and scalability.

## Migrating to GIT

1. **Assessment and Preparation**

   - Identify all PHP applications that need to be migrated.
   - Choose a version control system (VCS) such as Git, which is widely used.
   - Install and configure the chosen VCS on your development environment.

1. **Create a New Repository**
   - Create a new repository for each PHP application in your VCS.
   - Organize the repositories based on projects, if applicable.

1. **Initial Code Upload**
   - For each PHP application, perform an initial code upload to the respective repository.
   - Make sure to include all necessary files and directories.
   - Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., logs, temporary files).

1. **Branching Strategy**
   - Define a branching strategy that suits your development workflow.
   - Common strategies include "master" for production-ready code and feature branches for development.

1. **Collaboration Workflow**
   - Establish guidelines for collaboration using the VCS.
   - Define how developers will branch, merge, and resolve conflicts.
   - Document the workflow for your team.

1. **Integration with Development Tools**
   - Integrate the VCS with your development tools, such as code editors and IDEs.
   - Ensure team members are comfortable using the VCS within their development environments.

1. **Training and Documentation**
   - Provide training to your development team on using the VCS effectively.
   - Create documentation that outlines best practices for version control.

1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the entire process by making changes to the code and pushing them to the repository.
   - Ensure that team members can clone, fork, branch, and merge code successfully.

1. **Continuous Integration (CI) Integration**
   - Consider setting up CI tools like Jenkins or Travis CI to automate testing and deployment.
   - Configure CI pipelines to build and deploy your PHP applications.

1. **Backup and Recovery**
    - Implement a backup strategy for your repositories.
    - Ensure you have a plan for recovering code in case of accidental deletion or data loss.

1. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
    - Regularly monitor your repositories for issues and code quality.
    - Perform routine maintenance tasks, such as pruning branches and cleaning up outdated code.

1. **Scaling and Future Considerations**
    - As your codebase grows, consider implementing more advanced VCS features like tags for releases.
    - Keep an eye on new VCS tools and practices that can improve your workflow.

Remember that this migration may require some adjustments based on your team's specific needs and the complexity of your PHP applications. 
Regularly review and adapt your version control process to ensure it aligns with your development goals.
