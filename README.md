## Introduction

This repository is designed to house documentation in Markdown (.md) format for different domains within our company. Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-read markup language that all contributors should use when creating or editing documentation files. Markdown allows us to maintain consistent formatting and structure across all our documents.

## Folder Structure

We use a folder structure to organize documentation by domains or categories. Each domain will have its dedicated folder with relevant markdown files. Here is an example of the folder structure:

Please ensure that you place your documentation files in the appropriate folders to maintain organization.
